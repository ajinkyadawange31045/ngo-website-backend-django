          <p>
            SENA - Shiksha Evam Naitik Aadhar is a Bengaluru-based NGO dedicated to uplifting society through educational empowerment, moral and ethical development, and community engagement. We believe in fostering positive change by providing resources, support, and opportunities for individuals to grow holistically, from education to environmental awareness.

            Established with a focus on creating an inclusive society, SENA works at the grassroots level, focusing on Karnataka as our area of operation. Our efforts are aimed at marginalized communities, underprivileged groups, and especially children, women, and youth. We believe in not just providing education but ensuring that it is coupled with strong ethical values and leadership skills, enabling our beneficiaries to contribute positively to society.</p>
